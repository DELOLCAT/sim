<!-- 0: INTRODUCTION - THINK IN SYSTEMS, WITH SIMS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		A few years ago, I lived in California.
		Back then, it was (and still is) going through a nasty drought,
		causing severe water shortages and seasons of wildfires.
		Anyone trying to fix it would have to deal with a messy mix of
		environmental, economic, and political systems...
		all of which came together to create the
		perfect lack-of-rain-let-alone-a-storm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Point is, the world is filled with complex systems.
		They may seem impossible to change or comprehend,
		but I believe all of us can — and <i>must</i> — learn to
		<b>think in systems</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s where simulations come in!
		It’s easier to understand a system if you can <i>see</i> the system,
		or better yet, <i>play</i> with the system.
		So today, I’d like to share with you some simple simulations of the world...
		made in emoji. 🌲🌲🌲

<!-- 1: INTRODUCTION - SYSTEMS THEORY, PREDICT CHANGE -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		As it turns out, forest firefighters already use computer simulations
		to tackle wildfires, <i>in real time</i>.
		And it’s not just foresters.
		With the help of simulations, a growing group of scientists
		from different disciplines are realizing something strange:
		<i>all complex systems have things in common.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		So, in a way... Financial crises are like forest fires.
		Terrorist groups are like termite colonies.
		Pandemics are like a GIF everyone keeps sharing even though it’s already two days old.
		Since you can learn some core lessons about <i>all</i> systems from <i>any</i> system,
		let’s stick with our forest sim, and add one more rule:
	</p>
	<p>
		🌲→🔥: Trees can get struck by lightning &amp; catch on fire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sims can help <i>explain</i> a system,
		but they're also great for <i>exploring</i> systems,
		asking “What If?...”
		Like, <i>what</i> do you think will happen now,
		<i>if</i> you increased the growth rate?
		(Don’t worry, this question isn’t to judge or grade you,
		it’s solely for you to express your prediction)

	<p>
		Now, let’s see what happens...
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 1: WHAT IF, HIGHER GROWTH? -->
<div class="example">

<!-- 2: REFLECT, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS -->
<div class="words">
	<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

		<span value="more">
		Ah, you predicted that higher tree growth would lead to more trees.
		That’s an intuitive and obvious choice,
		so of course, it’s wrong.
		That’s because more trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the higher the growth, the faster and further the cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="less">
		Ah, you predicted that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees!
		Clever. However, that’s only half-true!
		I assume you figured out that more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but you forgot that <i>afterwards</i>,
		fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the higher the growth, the faster and further the cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="none">
		Heh, you must’ve thought I was giving you a trick question.
		I mean, I was, but still.
		Anyway, more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the higher the growth, the faster and further the cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="both">
		You predicted that you’d get both more trees <i>and</i> fewer trees?
		That doesn’t make sense, it’s a contradiction,
		so of course, you’re totally right!
		More trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but then, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → <i>more</i> trees, repeat.
		And the higher the growth, the faster and further the cycle spins.
		</span>

	</p>
	<p>
		🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
	</p>
	<p>
		This is <i>thinking in systems</i>.
		See, we’re so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect, A-changes-B.
		But most of the world is filled with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
		where A-changes-B-changes-A-changes-B, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first kind of feedback loop is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
		where more gets you even more.
		For example, in our simulation, fire creates more fire.
		This kind of loop leads to exponential growth.
	</p>
	<p>
		more leads to more: 🔥📈→🔥📈
	</p>
	<p>
		The second kind is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
		where more leads to less.
		It’s harder to find these kinds of loops,
		but there’s a trick: 
		think of a reinforcing loop.
		Then, think of what <i>stops</i> that loop from going to infinity.
		That’s your balancing loop.
		In our sim, fire makes more fire, but it can’t go on forever,
		because it'll run out of trees to burn.
		This kind of loop creates cyclical ups-and-downs.
	</p>
	<p>
		more leads to less: 🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉
 	</p>
	<p>
		This is why we’re so bad at handling complex issues.
		Everyone’s looking for the root cause,
		but if causality is not linear, but <i>loopy</i>,
		then there <i>is</i> no root cause!
	</p>
	<p>
		But that doesn’t mean we can’t still find ways to deal with complex problems.
		Again, simulations can help.
		In this next bit, you’re going to save the forest by <i>killing trees</i>:
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 2: CREATE A TREE-KILLING SOLUTION -->
<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where You’re In Charge Now, Somehow, I Guess
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_firebreak&play=1&edit=1"></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 3: CHANGING LOOPS, AND PLANTS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		Yup, you contained fire and helped more trees grow, <i>by killing trees</i>.
		And yes, forest firefighters actually do this!
		They make “firebreaks” by removing small trees, underbrush, and other flammable shtuff,
		to prevent wildfires from spreading through.
		This breaks the reinforcing loop of 🔥📈→🔥📈,
		which also reduces the balancing loop of 🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉.
	</p>
	<p>
		And <i>that</i> is how you change a system.
		Not by fiddling with numbers, or fighting the symptoms,
		but by <i>changing the core loops.</i>
	</p>
	<!--
	Footnote?
	[Also, note that in the previous sim,
	there was a tradeoff between more trees and more instability.
	But by changing the system, you got both more trees and more stability!
	That’s another mistake we tend to make when we try to solve problems:
	assuming there are fixed tradeoffs.
	Thinking in systems is more nuanced:
	recognizing there will always be tradeoffs,
	but that all tradeoffs can be changed.]
	-->
	<p>
		Now that you’ve gotten the hang of systems,
		let’s do one last forest sim!
		A forest wouldn’t be an ecosystem with just one species,
		so let’s simulate a forest with these two plants:
	</p>
	<p>
		🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
		invincible to fire, but if it’s surrounded by four or more Jerk Trees,
		it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌱 <b>Jerk Tree:</b>
		flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as the Strong Tree.
		Also, sometimes spontaneously bursts into flames.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve balanced these two so that, without your intervention,
		they’ll get a 50/50 split of the land.
		What do you predict will happen now, when you lay down firebreak walls?
		(Think <i>loopy</i>: what feedback loops are changed?)
	</p>

			<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
			Something completely different.
		</label>
		</form>
	</p>
	<p>
		And just for kicks, let’s ask another “What If”.
		What if you do the complete opposite of making firebreaks,
		and <i>keep setting random parts of the forest on fire?</i>
	</p>
