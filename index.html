<!-- 0: INTRODUCTION - THINK IN SYSTEMS, WITH SIMS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		A few years ago, I lived in California.
		Back then, it was (and still is) going through a nasty drought,
		causing severe water shortages and seasons of wildfires.
		Anyone trying to fix these would have to deal with a messy mix of
		environmental, economic, and political systems...
		all of which came together to create the
		perfect lack-of-rain-let-alone-a-storm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Point is, the world is filled with complex systems.
		They may seem impossible to change or comprehend,
		but I believe all of us can — and <i>must</i> — learn to
		<b>think in systems</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s where simulations come in!
		It’s easier to understand a system if you can <i>see</i> the system,
		or better yet, <i>play</i> with the system.
		So today, I’d like to share with you some simple simulations of the world...
		made in emoji. 🌲🌲🌲
	</p>

<!-- 1: INTRODUCTION - SYSTEMS THEORY, PREDICT CHANGE -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		As it turns out, forest firefighters already use computer simulations
		to tackle wildfires, <i>in real time</i>.
		And it’s not just foresters.
		With the help of simulations, a growing group of scientists
		from different disciplines are realizing something strange:
		<i>all complex systems have things in common.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		So, in a way... Financial crises are like forest fires.
		Terrorist groups are like termite colonies.
		Pandemics are like a GIF everyone keeps sharing even though it’s not that funny.
		Since you can learn some core lessons about <i>all</i> systems from <i>any</i> system,
		let’s stick with our forest sim, and add one more rule:
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		🌲→🔥: Trees can get struck by lightning &amp; catch on fire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sims can help <i>explain</i> a system,
		but they're also great for <i>exploring</i> systems,
		asking “What If?...”
		Like, <i>what</i> do you think will happen now,
		<i>if</i> you increased the growth rate?
		(Don’t worry, this question isn’t to judge or grade you,
		it’s solely for you to express your prediction)

	</p>
	<p>
		Now, let’s see what happens...
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 1: WHAT IF, HIGHER GROWTH? -->

<!-- 2: REFLECT, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS -->
<div class="words">
	<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

		<span value="more">
		Ah, you predicted that higher tree growth would lead to more trees.
		That’s an intuitive and obvious choice,
		so of course, it’s wrong.
		That’s because more trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="less">
		Ah, you predicted that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees!
		Clever. However, that’s only half-true!
		I assume you figured out that more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but you forgot that <i>afterwards</i>,
		fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="none">
		Heh, you must’ve thought I was giving you a trick question.
		I mean, I was, but still.
		Anyway, more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="both">
		You predicted that you’d get both more trees <i>and</i> fewer trees?
		That doesn’t make sense, it’s a contradiction,
		so of course, you’re totally right!
		More trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but then, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → <i>more</i> trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
	</p>
	<p>
		This is <i>thinking in systems</i>.
		See, we’re so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect, A-changes-B.
		But most of the world is filled with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
		where A-changes-B-changes-A-changes-B, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first kind of feedback loop is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
		where more gets you even more.
		For example, in our simulation, fire creates more fire.
		This kind of loop tends towards exponential growth.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to more:<br>
		🔥📈→🔥📈
	</p>
	<p>
		The second kind is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
		where more leads to less.
		It’s harder to find these kinds of loops,
		but there’s a trick: 
		think of a reinforcing loop.
		Then, think of what <i>stops</i> that loop from going to infinity.
		That’s your balancing loop.
		In our sim, fire makes more fire, but it can’t go on forever,
		because it'll run out of trees to burn.
		This kind of loop tends to make cyclical ups-and-downs.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to less:<br>
		🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉
 	</p>
	<p>
		This is why we’re so bad at handling complex issues.
		Everyone’s looking for the root cause,
		but if causality is not linear, but <i>loopy</i>,
		then there <i>is</i> no root cause!
	</p>
	<p>
		But that doesn’t mean we can’t still solve problems.
		Again, sims can help us ask “What If?”, and try out different strategies...
		such as saving a forest, by <i>killing trees</i>:
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 2: CREATE A TREE-KILLING SOLUTION -->
<div class="example">

		<b>A Forest</b> Where You Show Trees No Mercy

	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_firebreak&play=1&edit=1&paused=1"></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 3: CHANGING LOOPS, AND PLANTS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		Yup, you contained fire and helped more trees grow, <i>by killing trees</i>.
		And yes, forest firefighters actually do this!
		They make “firebreaks” by removing small trees, underbrush, and other flammable shtuff,
		to prevent wildfires from spreading through.
		This breaks the reinforcing loop of 🔥📈→🔥📈,
		which also reduces the balancing loop of 🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉.
	</p>
	<p>
		And <i>that</i> is how you change a system.
		Not by fiddling with numbers, or fighting the symptoms,
		but by <i>changing the core loops.</i>
	</p>
	<!--
	Footnote?
	[Also, note that in the previous sim,
	there was a tradeoff between more trees and more instability.
	But by changing the system, you got both more trees and more stability!
	That’s another mistake we tend to make when we try to solve problems:
	assuming there are fixed tradeoffs.
	Thinking in systems is more nuanced:
	recognizing there will always be tradeoffs,
	but that all tradeoffs can be changed.]
	-->
	<p>
		Now that you’ve gotten the hang of systems,
		let’s do one last forest sim!
		A forest wouldn’t be an ecosystem with just one species,
		so let’s simulate a forest with these two plants:
	</p>
	<p>
		🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
		invincible to fire, but if it’s surrounded by four or more Jerk Trees,
		it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌱 <b>Jerk Tree:</b>
		flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as the Strong Tree.
		Also, sometimes spontaneously bursts into flames.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve balanced these two so that, without your intervention,
		they’ll get a 50/50 split of the land.
		What do you predict will happen now, when you lay down firebreak walls?
		(Think <i>loopy</i>: what feedback loops are changed?)
	</p>
	<p>
		<form name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_choice">

			<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same" checked>

			Something completely different.
		</label>
		</form>
	</p>
	<p>
		And just for kicks, let’s ask another “What If”.
		What if you do the complete opposite of making firebreaks,
		and <i>keep setting random parts of the forest on fire?</i>
	</p>

<div class="words">
	<p>
		Before we reflect on your predictions,
		did you notice how the plants formed <i>clusters</i>,
		even though <i>no rule told them to?</i>
		Scientists call this <b>self-organization</b>,
		when order comes from the bottom up.
		This is contrary to the popular belief
		that order <i>must</i> come from the top down.
		Self-organization also means a system
		can automatically <b>adapt</b> to new situations,
		for better or worse.
		Which brings us to your predictions...
	</p>
	<p name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_reflect">
		<span value="same">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would <i>not</i> affect the ratio of plants, which is an understandable guess! However, in an interconnected system, changing one part usually changes all the others, thanks to self-organization. Here, walls limit fire, fire limits Jerks, and Jerks limit Strongs.
		</span>
		<span value="strong">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would help the Strong Tree win. I assume you guessed that if firebreaks made the <i>forest</i> more fireproof, it should make the <i>trees</i> more fireproof, too. However, thanks to self-organization, the whole is <i>completely different</i> from the sum of its parts. So while your walls <i>did</i> lead to less fire, less fire means more Jerks, and more Jerks mean less Strongs.
		</span>
		<span value="jerk">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would let the Jerk Tree win. And you were totally correct! Your walls limit fire, fire limits Jerks, and Jerks limit Strongs. Let’s stop to appreciate that you held <i>three different system relationships in your head</i>, and accurately predicted how they would self-organize!
		</span>
		<span value="what">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought the plants would do something nuts. Maybe you thought they’d cycle back and forth, like an earlier sim did. However, because the Strong Tree doesn’t affect fire <i>or</i> Jerks, there’s no loop there, and thus no Jerk-Strong cycle. (There <i>are</i> other loops, though) Instead, what happened was: your walls led to less fire, less fire meant more Jerks, and more Jerks meant less Strongs. That’s how they self-organized.

		PREDICTION #2: you thought setting stuff on fire would not change the plant ratio. But instead, more fire led to Strong Trees winning, and therefore, <i>less</i> fire. Paradoxical. What happened is same logic as before, except with “more” and “less” <i>flipped around:</i>

		PREDICTION #2: you thought setting stuff on fire would help the Strong Tree win. And, you’re right! Not only that, adding more fire also leads to <i>less</i> fire in the long run, paradoxically. It’s the same logic as before, except with “more” and “less” <i>flipped around:</i>

		You might be skeptical about these results.
		And I hope you are! It’s good to be critical!
		I mean, this sim is basically saying 
		<i>fire is good for the forest</i>.
		That can't be right.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌲But consider the Jack Pine.
		Its pine cones are sealed with wax,
		and can't release its seeds until <i>a forest fire melts the wax away</i>.
		Our hypothetical Strong Tree was merely immune to wildfires.
		The Jack Pine, one of many fire-dependent trees,
		<i>is born out of fire</i> — like the legendary Phoenix.
	</p>
	<p>
		🔥Also, consider that Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals
		used to <i>deliberately</i> set fires,
		under safe weather conditions,
		to maintain forest diversity and stability.
		In contrast, the U.S. Forest Service once decreed
		that <i>all</i> fires must be put out by 10 a.m. the next day.
		The plan backfired (haha),
		and made forests unhealthier in the long run.
		But to this day, there's still heated debate (haha)
		over if we should let more fires burn,
		or even <i>actively set fires.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		🏠Heck, <i>I’m</i> also skeptical if we should set more fires.
		There are legitimate concerns about smoke,
		and accidentally burning people’s homes down.
		I don’t envy whoever has to make the decision to let someone lose their home,
		so that in the future, others won’t.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are complex issues.
		But that’s exactly why we need to think in <i>systems</i>, to tackle these problems.
		Not just for forest fires, but <i>all</i> the global challenges we face:

<!-- 5: THE STAKES OF EDU SIMS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		A few months ago, on September 12th, 2015,
		California had the third-worst wildfire in its entire history.
		Dozens of towns were evacuated,
		people fleeing from their houses.
		When the fire was finally contained one month later,
		it had spread to 70,000 acres,
		and over a thousand homes burnt down.
	</p>
	<p>
		If more small fires were allowed to burn up fuel beforehand,
		this disaster might not have been as bad.
		However, due to public pressure to aggressively put out fires —
		which is very, <i>very</i> understandable given tragedies like the one above,
		and I'm not blaming <i>anybody</i> —
		forest firefighters can’t let as many fires burn as they probably should.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like I said, forest firefighters <i>already</i> use computer sims to tackle wildfires.
		What if they had simpler versions of those sims,
		to teach people about the forests' <i>systems</i>?
		Would they have gotten public support to try counterintuitive, but better, solutions?
		Could homes and lives have been saved?
		And if so, how about educating people on
		all the <i>other</i> complex systems that affect us?
	</p>
	<p>
		This is what this whole article has been leading up to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe all of us can &mdash; and <i>must</i> &mdash;
		understand the systems that run our world.
		I'd like you to think of a big problem that <i>you</i> personally and deeply care about.
		Knowing what you know now about systems, feedback loops, and self-organization...

<!-- EPILOGUE: FROM THE BOTTOM UP -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
	Scientists, policymakers, forest firefighters...
	they all <i>already</i> use simulations to explain, explore, and experiment
	with real-world systems.
	However, these sims usually aren’t meant to be used or understood by us,
	the public — <i>the very people those real-world systems impact the most.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	This interactive essay was born out of 1) boredom,
	and 2) a “What If?”
	What if complex systems were explained in a way all of us could understand,
	or, what if we had a tool to think and talk in systems?
	<i>What if playing IS making, reading IS writing, and learning IS teaching?</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	This isn’t just a more effective way of <i>transmitting</i> knowledge.
	Like a game of Telephone,
	transmissions will always slowly get lost over time.

	<p>
	What if, instead, we could also <i>change</i> their model?
	We could use the simulation to try different “What If?” scenarios,
	create new solutions, challenge their core assumptions,

	We could self-organize to understand the world from the bottom up,
	heck,
	even <i>change the world from the bottom up!</i>

	<p>
