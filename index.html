<!-- 0: INTRODUCTION - THINK IN SYSTEMS, WITH SIMS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		So, I used to live in California.
		Back then, it was (and still is) going through a rather nasty drought,
		causing water shortages and wildfires.
		Anyone trying to fix these would have to deal with a messy mix of
		environmental, economic, and political systems...
		all of which came together to create the
		perfect lack-of-rain-let-alone-a-storm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Point is, the world's filled with complex systems.
		These systems that run our lives may seem impossible to change, or even comprehend,
		but I truly believe all of us can — and <i>must</i> — learn to
		<b>think in systems</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s where simulations come in!
		It’s easier to understand a system if you can <i>see</i> the system,
		or better yet, <i>play</i> with the system.
		So today, I’d like to share with you some simple simulations of the world...
		made in emoji. 🌲🌲🌲

		<span value="more">
		Ah, you predicted that higher tree growth would lead to more trees.
		That’s an intuitive and obvious choice,
		so of course, it’s wrong.
		That’s because more trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="less">
		Ah, you predicted that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees!
		Clever. However, that’s only half-true!
		I assume you figured out that more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but you forgot that <i>afterwards</i>,
		fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="none">
		Heh, you must’ve thought I was giving you a trick question.
		I mean, I was, but still.
		Anyway, more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="both">
		You predicted that you’d get both more trees <i>and</i> fewer trees?
		That doesn’t make sense, it’s a contradiction,
		so of course, you’re totally right!
		More trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but then, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → <i>more</i> trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.

	<p style="text-align:center">
		🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
	</p>
	<p>
		This is <i>thinking in systems</i>.
		See, we’re so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect, A-changes-B.
		But most of the world is filled with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
		where A-changes-B-changes-A-changes-B, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first kind of feedback loop is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
		where more gets you even more.
		For example, in our simulation, fire creates more fire.
		<i>Exponential growth</i> tends to emerge from this kind of loop.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to more:<br>
		🔥📈→🔥📈
	</p>
	<p>
		The second kind is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
		where more leads to <i>less</i>.
		It’s harder to find these kinds of loops,
		but there’s a trick: 
		first, think of a reinforcing loop.
		Then, think of what <i>stops</i> that loop from going to infinity.
		That’s your balancing loop.
		In our sim, fire makes more fire, but it can’t go on forever,
		coz it'll run out of trees to burn.
		<i>Cyclical ups-and-downs</i> emerge from this loop.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to less:<br>
		🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉
 	</p>
	<p>
		This is why we’re so bad at handling complex issues.
		Everyone’s looking for the root cause,
		but if causality is not linear, but <i>loopy</i>,
		then there <i>is</i> no root cause!
	</p>
	<p>
		But that doesn’t mean we can’t still solve problems.
		Sims let us do experiments that would be too impractical or impossible to try out for realsies.
		For example, in this next experiment,
		you're going to help more trees grow,
		<i>by killing trees</i>.
		Stop.
		Think for a moment.
		How could that even be possible?
		Now.
		Let's do it.
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 2: CREATE A TREE-KILLING SOLUTION -->
<div class="example">

</div>

<!-- 3: CHANGING LOOPS, AND PLANTS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		Consider how counterintuitive that is.
		By killing trees, you helped there be <i>more</i> trees.
		And yes, forest firefighters <i>actually</i> do this!
		They make “firebreaks” by removing small trees, underbrush, and other flammable shtuff,
		to prevent wildfires from spreading through.
		This breaks the reinforcing loop of 🔥📈→🔥📈,
		which also reduces the balancing loop of 🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>That</i> is how you change a system.
		Not by fighting symptoms or pushing numbers,
		but by <i>changing the core loops.</i>
	</p>
	<!--
	Footnote?
	[Also, note that in the previous sim,
	there was a tradeoff between more trees and more instability.
	But by changing the system, you got both more trees and more stability!
	That’s another mistake we tend to make when we try to solve problems:
	assuming there are fixed tradeoffs.
	Thinking in systems is more nuanced:
	recognizing there will always be tradeoffs,
	but that all tradeoffs can be changed.]
	-->
	<p>
		Now that you've gotten a taste of thinking in loops,
		let's do two final experiments on our fake forest.
		A forest wouldn’t be an ecosystem with just one species,
		so let’s simulate a forest with these two plants:
	</p>
	<p>
		🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
		invincible to fire, but if it’s surrounded by four or more Jerk Trees,
		it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌱 <b>Jerk Tree:</b>
		flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as the Strong Tree.
		Also, sometimes spontaneously bursts into flames.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve balanced it so that, normally,
		these plants will get a 50/50 split of the land.
		But <i>after you create firebreaks</i>,
		what do you think will happen?
		(think loopy: what feedback loops are changed?
		what would emerge from those changes?)
	</p>
	<p>
		<form name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_choice">

<div class="words">
	<p>
		Did you notice how, in the 50/50 normal case, the plants formed clusters
		even though <i>no rule told them to?</i>
		Scientists call this <b>self-organization</b>.
		This is when order emerges from the <i>bottom up,</i>
		contrary to the popular belief
		that order always comes from the <i>top down.</i>
		Self-organization also means a system
		can automatically <b>adapt</b> to new scenarios,
		for better or worse.
		Which brings us to your predictions...

	<p name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_reflect">
		<span value="same">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would <i>not</i> affect the ratio of plants, which is an understandable guess!

		</span>
		<span value="strong">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would help the Strong Tree win. I assume you guessed that if firebreaks made the <i>forest</i> more fireproof, it should make the <i>trees</i> more fireproof, too. However, thanks to self-organization, the whole is <i>completely different</i> from the sum of its parts. So while your walls <i>did</i> lead to less fire, less fire means more Jerks, and more Jerks mean less Strongs.

		<span value="jerk">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would let the Jerk Tree win. And you were totally correct! Your walls limit fire, fire limits Jerks, and Jerks limit Strongs.

		</span>
		<span value="what">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought the plants would do something nuts. Maybe you thought they’d cycle back and forth, like an earlier sim did. However, because the Strong Tree doesn’t affect fire <i>or</i> Jerks, there’s no loop there, and thus no Jerk-Strong cycle. (There <i>are</i> other loops, though) Instead, what happened was: your walls led to less fire, less fire meant more Jerks, and more Jerks meant less Strongs. That’s how they self-organized.

		You might be skeptical about these results.
		And I hope you are! It’s good to be critical!
		I mean, this sim is basically saying 
		<i>fire is good for the forest</i>.
		That can't be right.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌲But consider the Jack Pine.
		Its pine cones are sealed with wax,
		and can't release its seeds until <i>a forest fire melts the wax away</i>.
		Our hypothetical Strong Tree was merely <i>immune</i> to wildfires.
		The Jack Pine, one of many fire-dependent trees,
		is <i>born</i> out of fire — much like the legendary Phoenix.
	</p>
	<p>
		🔥Also, consider that Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals
		used to <i>deliberately</i> set fires,
		under safe weather conditions,
		to maintain forest diversity and stability.
		In contrast, the U.S. Forest Service once decreed
		that <i>all</i> fires must be put out by 10 a.m. the next day,
		which backfired (haha),
		and might've made forests unhealthier in the long run.
		And to this day, there's still heated debate (haha)
		over if we should let more fires burn,
		or even <i>actively set fires.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		🏠Heck, <i>I’m</i> also skeptical if we should set more fires.
		There are legitimate concerns about smoke,
		and accidentally burning people’s homes down.
		I don’t envy whoever has to make the decision to let someone lose their home,
		so that in the future, others won’t.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are complex problems, and there'll never be One Best Solution.
		But that’s exactly why we gotta think in systems,
		not just to tackle wildfires,
		but <i>all</i> the global challenges we face.
	</p>
	<p>
		So here's <b>a gallery of simulations</b>,
		modeling some of our world's biggest problems.
		Think critically. Play critically.
		Create solutions I haven't even thought of.
		Challenge my assumptions by changing the rules.
		Think of experiments to do, predict what will happen, then do them.
